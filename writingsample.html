<h4>Bomber Intentions</h4>
<p class="dropcap"> Eric Rudolph set off four bombs between 1996 and 1998 targeted to destroy anti-abortion clinics. He used nitroglycerin dynamite to kill a mother and daughter, and injured hundreds of other individuals. Rudolph, like many other bombers, was a classifiably sick person. He was opposed to women having rights to her own body, the gay community, and he especially despised the government accommodating to anybody that would practice the aforementioned. His motives were obvious, and he was clearly a prolife individual. It took four years for police to finally get Rudolph into custody. Eric hid in caves and squatted in cabins to avoid police capture. Rudolph only traveled at night and he lived off of things such as; grains from a local granary, produce from loading docks, and left-overs from restaurant dumpsters. FBI Officials on sight at arrest stated, “When he was arrested he was actually pretty compliant and subdued. Almost relieved in a sense. His attitude was, ‘You got me.’ And that was part of our plan.”. (Eric Rudolph 2016)
</p>
<p> Timothy Mcveigh committed a bombing on the 19th of April 1995 that killed over 100 people, and injured dozens more. Mcveigh was a decorated U.S. Army soldier, and used a dieselized fuel-fertilizer bomb to attack a federal building in Oklahoma. His motives were based on the events that took place in Waco, Texas in 1993, and another previous shooting in 1992. The shooting in 1992 was between “federal agents and survivalist Randy Weaver” (Timothy McVeigh convicted for Oklahoma City bombing 2020).  Randy Weaver’s wife and son were killed during this shoot out. This act of violence hit close to home for Mcveigh and his counter part Terry Nichols. Leading them to commit the gruesome act of putting a bomb into a rental truck and exploding a federal building. This bombing not only injured and killed adults, but children as well. While both of these bombings were horribly gruesome acts of violence, Mcveighs acts were a little more organized and justifiable than the acts of Rudolph. Though Mcveigh was captured much faster than Rudolph. In June 1997 Mcveigh was convicted of 15 counts of murder, and sentenced to death by lethal injection.

  <h4>Deception in the Real-World</h4>
<p class="dropcap">It is natural for people to want to stay out of trouble. Human’s are also prone to manipulating and fabricating false information to get an intended outcome. People that lie often times learn this behavior at a young age. If a child sees what they want and realizes they can’t obtain it with the truth, they will lie. Many children bring this deceiving nature into adulthood to ensure that they are always able to get what they desire.  Kang Lee states, “Lying, like any other moral or immoral behavior, increasingly is thought to be influenced not only by universal moral principles but by social conventions.” (81). Meaning that a child often learns this behavior from lack of discipline and proper morals, and can be exacerbated because of social settings. 
</p>
<p>Children that deceive others are able to read their situation, and their crowd. This social assessment will allow the child to get away with the lie, and receive the intended outcome. Little liars are also able to evaluate the amount of trouble they will get into with their lies by assessing their surrounding audience.  “For example, most societies eschew lying to conceal transgressions for personal gain. However, some societies encourage white lies that spare the feelings of the person being lied to” (Lee 81). Meaning, a child is more likely to lie if they feel that their surrounding society approves of it.  </p>
<p>In most cases, these “little liars” end up to be grown up’s with influence on society. All the aforementioned information about lying children applies to adults that are prone to fibbing as well. Making society a questionable place for the gullible. It is not always good or bad for people to believe what they see, sometimes it’s mutual. Often times, information is manipulated for the intended audience. D.C. Morse of US News Magazine, is in charge of ranking universities within the United States. Morse admitted “there was no formal reason for that position. It was just a feeling.” (Gladwell 12). Meaning Morse made these rankings on a whim, not based on factual information. This could be construed as a lie by his overall audience. Morse, like many children, new he had to lie and manipulate information to get the job and the intended outcome he wanted. He based his rankings on the material he knew his audience was interested in. Not to benefit his audience, but to benefit himself. </p>
<p>There is no black or white in some situations, only grey. That is why both of these articles have been synthesized together. Adults sometimes have to lie in order to save people from harm or give them the information they desire. In the case of D.C. Morse, he must lie because his audience only needs a specific scope of information. He is forced to rank those colleges with a certain rubric in mind. Morse delivers on the information he knows his audience wants to see, and leaves the rest out. Just like a lying child would do. The point is, sometimes lying is not always an undesirable trait. Sometimes lying is a defense mechanism, an option for success, or even a necessity. People have an innate urge to protect themselves, and to excel. That is exactly what Morse is doing when he deciphers information for his news articles. Lying is a trait learned in early childhood, and if used correctly can actually benefit the deceiver. A little liar’s ability to read their peers can be proven to be a useful skill in future instances. Morse uses his information with-holding abilities in a more favorable way, by assisting his readers in finding the proper college for themselves and their children. </p>
