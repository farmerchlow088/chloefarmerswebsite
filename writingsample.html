<h4>Bomber Intention</h4>
<p class="dropcap"> Eric Rudolph set off four bombs between 1996 and 1998 targeted to destroy anti-abortion clinics. He used nitroglycerin dynamite to kill a mother and daughter, and injured hundreds of other individuals. Rudolph, like many other bombers, was a classifiably sick person. He was opposed to women having rights to her own body, the gay community, and he especially despised the government accommodating to anybody that would practice the aforementioned. His motives were obvious, and he was clearly a prolife individual. It took four years for police to finally get Rudolph into custody. Eric hid in caves and squatted in cabins to avoid police capture. Rudolph only traveled at night and he lived off of things such as; grains from a local granary, produce from loading docks, and left-overs from restaurant dumpsters. FBI Officials on sight at arrest stated, “When he was arrested he was actually pretty compliant and subdued. Almost relieved in a sense. His attitude was, ‘You got me.’ And that was part of our plan.”. (Eric Rudolph 2016)

<p> Timothy Mcveigh committed a bombing on the 19th of April 1995 that killed over 100 people, and injured dozens more. Mcveigh was a decorated U.S. Army soldier, and used a dieselized fuel-fertilizer bomb to attack a federal building in Oklahoma. His motives were based on the events that took place in Waco, Texas in 1993, and another previous shooting in 1992. The shooting in 1992 was between “federal agents and survivalist Randy Weaver” (Timothy McVeigh convicted for Oklahoma City bombing 2020).  Randy Weaver’s wife and son were killed during this shoot out. This act of violence hit close to home for Mcveigh and his counter part Terry Nichols. Leading them to commit the gruesome act of putting a bomb into a rental truck and exploding a federal building. This bombing not only injured and killed adults, but children as well. While both of these bombings were horribly gruesome acts of violence, Mcveighs acts were a little more organized and justifiable than the acts of Rudolph. Though Mcveigh was captured much faster than Rudolph. In June 1997 Mcveigh was convicted of 15 counts of murder, and sentenced to death by lethal injection.

<h4>Discussion 2</h4>
<p class="dropcap">I enjoyed this series of pages because the author explains how hypertext can bring words and ideas to life. Richard Lanham is a well-renowned author who believes that human brains respond to graphics and digital text the same way they might respond to "oral discourse" (7). I find that many people in the 21st century are dulled by a wordy article with no graphics. Applen states, British classicist Eric Havelock believed that putting words on paper created an analytic and thoughtless process for people (7). Lanham uses that belief of Havelocks to defend digital text.
</p>
<p>This section is interesting because it points out the main differences between typed words on paper and digital text. Words on paper give people the sense that they cannot change or manipulate the presented words and meanings. On digital devices with digital text, people can manipulate things any way they want. People are taught certain forms of situational manipulation from infancy as an instinctual survival method. Creating an innate need for the manipulation of written and spoken language.</p>
<p>Another aspect of this section I enjoyed is the concept of "Variability". Current computer programs and digital text are not just based on any one thing (8). They are constantly changing and conforming to the user. Allowing the user to create their own narrative using technology. Written and spoken words permanent, for the most part. Once a person writes something on paper or verbally says something, they cannot take it back. They can't add or subtract from the thing they said. With digital text, words and images can be modified indefinitely.</p>
